// gocha:
// 1. According to Normmatt, YopYop had released the final version of original desmume as public domain.
// 2. I asked DeSmuME team about the problem between GPL and Snes9x license, but no one raised any objections.
// Therefore, I decided to include this code into snes9x-rr project.
// Dear DeSmuME coders: if it is not allowed, please tell me.
